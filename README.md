# Study Smarter, Not Harder: Using SHAP for Actionable Educational Insights
This repository is part of a research article for my masters program in Artificial Intelligence at the Open Universiteit.

## Getting started
To get started, make sure to install Python 3.12 (other version might also be compatible, but were not tested) and the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 

There are two Jupyter notebook files. The first one runs the models and calculates the SHAP-values. The second one investigates which factors students should work on based on statistical tests.

## Article and citations
This repository is part of a larger project described in the article:

"Study Smarter, Not Harder: Using SHAP for Actionable Educational Insights" by Finn Alberts (2025).

The article details the research questions, methods, and findings of this project, aiming to give actionable advice to students in how to improve their academic success. If you're interested in the background, methodology, or results, please refer to the article for a comprehensive overview, and is available at [my personal website](https://finnalberts.nl/projecten/open-universiteit/study-smarter-not-harder).
